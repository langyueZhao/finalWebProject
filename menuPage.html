        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Nowadays, all the important areas of people's daily lives are digitised. We work, play and play online. E-sports have become the number one sport and beauty filters work better than make-up.</p>
          <p>With the advent of television, our attention to the real world dropped to 85%.</p>
          <p>With the advent of computers, our attention to the real world fell to 70%.</p>
          <p>With the advent of mobile phones, our attention to the real world fell to 50%.</p>
        <p>If this trend continues, one day our attention to digital life will rise from 50% to over 90%, and that moment will be the singularity of the meta-universe, because we will consider virtual life more important than real life.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>

        <p>The metaverse is the "metaverse". verse is the universe, meta is a bit more complicated and comes from the ancient Greece.

          At that time, the Athenians called the study of things that had a physical body "physics", which later developed into physics.
          And the study of things without form was called metaphysics, which translates as metaphysics. This is the origin of meta.
          The real universe we live in is the universe, and the corresponding virtual universe is the metaverse.
          Many articles say that the metaverse originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash,
          in which author Neal Stephenson depicted a virtual parallel digital world (metaverse) in which people lived, worked, and played with Avatars. </P>
          <br>
        <p>But anyone who knows anything about the science fiction genre knows that this framework is called Cyberpunk.
          The genre was pioneered by Vernor Vinci's "Real Names" in 1981 and William Gibson's "Neuromancer" in 1984.
          Snow Crash was merely the creation of the word metaverse to name cyberspace.</p>

        <p>For the future of human beings, science fiction is roughly divided into two schools of thought:
          the "spaceship school" and the "metaverse school". The so-called "spaceship school", or the "meta-universe school",
          believes that the future of human beings lies in the vast and boundless universe, and that our journey is to the stars and the sea.
          Unfortunately, in 2021, mankind has still not been able to fly beyond the gravitational range of the Earth.</p>
          <br>
        <p>That's why some people start to believe that the metaverse is the future of human beings,
          and even say nonsense like "the universe should only be a physical part of the metaverse,
          and even the parallel universe is only a part of the metaverse".</p>

        <p>At this point in time, we do not have a very clear and objective definition of the concept of "metaverse", and everyone is talking about their own understanding. </p>

        <p>Unlike the setting in cyberpunk in science fiction, the definition of metaverse is now not just a virtual space.
          The development of blockchain technology and NFT (non-homogenized tokens) has allowed the economic system of the metaverse to be connected to the real world.</p>

        <p>In other words, the game master in science fiction may be penniless in real life, or even scrimp and save to buy game equipment, like Top Gun.
          But now the meta-universe experts can support their families and even become rich in real life just by the NFT they earn in the game.</p>
